### Returning from Procedure
```nasm
lis $5  ; $5 contains the address somewhere
.word f  ; the procedure f begins
jr $5  ; how do we get back HERE?
(HERE)
```

* After you call a procedure, how do you get back to where you were?
* When we return from a procedure, we need to set PC to the line after the `jr`. 
* We can do this with the register `jalr` or the *jump and link register*. The instruction is exactly like `jr`, but it also sets `$31` to the address of the next instruction (i.e. `PC`).
* However, since this overwrites `$31`, now we need to save `$31` onto the call stack whenever we call a procedure, and then pop it before returning.
* Our mainline template now looks like this:

```nasm
main:
    lis $5  ; store f into $5
    .word f
    sw $31, -4($30)  ; push $31 onto stack
    lis $31
    .word 4
    sub $30, $30, $31  ; update stack pointer
    jalr $5  ; call f
    lis $31
    .word 4
    add $30, $30, $31  ; update stack pointer
    lw $31, -4($30)  ; pop $31
    jr  $31
```

### Parameter/Result Passing
* The best option is to pass or return parameters via registers.
* However, this makes it complicated with respect to figuring out where registers/parameters are.
* If this is done, the procedure writer MUST document their code so that the client knows which registers will be passed backwards and forwards.
* The largest problem is that there are only 32 registers.
* A better option is to push parameters onto the stack. This also requires documentation.

### Full Code Example
* Here is an example of a fully documented procedure.
* We will write a function which will sum the first n numbers.

``` nasm
; sum 1 to N
; Registers
;   $1 - working
;   $2 - input
;   $3 - output

sum1toN:
    sw $1, -4($30)
    sw $2, -8($30)  ; push register $1, $2
    lis $1
    .word 8
    sub $30, $30, $1  ; decimal stack pointer
    add $3, $0, $0  ; initialize $1
    .word 1

top:  ; the actual adding part
    add $3, $3, $2
    sub $2, $2, $1
    bne $2, $0, top

    lis $1
    .word 8  ; update $1
    add $30, $30, $1  ; increment $30
    lw $2, -8($30)  ; pop registers
    jr $31  ; return

### Recursion
* Recursion isn't different from any other function call.
* If registers, parameters, and the stack are managed correctly, recursion will work.

### Input and Output
* Input is not supported. Deal with it!
* Output: MIPS provides a location (`0xfff000c`) called video memory, to store words where the least significant byte will be printed to the screen.
* Example: print CS, followed by newline

```nasm
lis $1
.word 0xffff000c
lis $2
.word 67  ; ASCII C
sw $2, 0($1)
lis $2
.word 83  ; ASCII S
sw $2, 0($1)
lis $2
.word 10  ; ASCII \n
sw $2, 0($1)
jr $31
```

### The Assembler
* An assembler is a program that translates assembly code into equivalent machine code. 
* Any translation process involves two steps:
    * **Analysis**, to understand what is meant by the source string
    * ***Synthesis**, to output an equivalent target string
* An assembly file (`.asm`) is just a stream of characters, a text file.

So, parsing basically proceeds as follows:
1) **Tokenization**. Group characters into meaningful **tokens**. For example, labels, hex numbers, regular numbers, `.word`, registers, etc. This has been done for us; we will talk about it in far more detail later. (e.g. for the C++ starter code, each token is an instance of the Token class.)
2) **Analysis**. Group tokens into instructions, if possible.
3) **Synthesis**. Output equivalent machine code.

* If tokens are not arranged into sensible instructions, output `ERROR` to standard error.
* Advice: there are many more wrong configuration than right ones, for an assembly file. For example, the instruction `beq $1, $0, abc` can be a sequence to token types: e.g. `ID REGISTER COMMA REGISTER COMMMA ID` 

* How do we assemble the following code?

```nasm
beq $1, $0, abc
...
abc: add $3, $3, $3
```

* In the example above, we don't know what `abc` is until the line which declares the label.
* The biggest problem with writing an assembler is storing identifiers.
* The solution is to scan through the source string in multiple passes.
* In the first pass, group the tokens into instructions and record the addresses of all labelled instructions into a **symbol table**, a data structure containing (name, address) tuples.
    * A line assembly can have one more label. You can label the line after the end.
* In the second pass, translate each instruction into machine code. If an instruction refers to a label, look up the associated address inthe symbol table.
* Our assembler should output the assembled MIPS to `stdout`, and we should output the symbol table to `stderr`.

### Assembling, Trace
```nasm
main: 
    lis $2
    .word 13
    add $3, $0, $6
top: 
    add $3, $3, $3
    lis $1
    .word 1
    sub $2, $2, $1
    bne $2, $0, top
    jr $31
```
