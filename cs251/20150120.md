### Designing an FSM
Mostly covered the design of an FSM for a hypothetical light rail transit system.

### More stuff on SRAM
See section *Random Access Memories* for [2015/01/15](20150115.md).

### Three-State Buffer or Transmission Gate
* Has three outputs: 0, 1, and *floating* (connected to neither power nor ground).
* *C* is the control line. It is a bit which decides where there will be output to *F*.
* When C is 0, both transistors are off, and output is floating.
* Otherwise, input passes through.
* High-impedance outputs can be "tied together" without problems.

### Dynamic RAM
* Our SRAM cell still uses a lot of transistors. 
* A better implementation uses six transistors, which is still expensive.
* An alternative is to use a capacitor to store a charge to represent 1, but the problem is that the charge will dissipate and must be refreshed.
* To write to a DRAM, place the value on the bit line.
* To read, put half-voltage on the bit line, and input 1 on the word line.
* Chrage in the capacitor will slightly increase bit line voltage, no charge will slightly decrease voltage.
* This is detected, amplified, and written back.

### Design of 4Mx1 DRAM
* The 20-bit address provided 10 bits at a time.
* A whole row is read at once. 
* Column address selects a single bit.
