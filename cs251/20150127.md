### Data Representation and Manipulation - Part 2
* Previously, we covered the **two's complement** numeral system (On 2015/01/24, I didn't go to class), which represents binary numbers such that the most significant bit represents a negative number. Then, for an *n*-bit binary number, a two's complement number can represent anything from `-(2^(n-1))` to `2^(n-1) - 1`.

### Adders
*

### Multiplication
* 

### Hexadecimal
* Hexadecimal is a numeral system which is based on 16. The digits are `0123456789ABCDEF`.
* The advantage of hexadecimal is that each hex digit takes exactly four bits.

### Representing Non-Integral Numbers
* We can use scientific notation to represent floating point numbers.
* There are two main parts to scientific notation: Sign, and significand (fraction, mantissa, exponent)
* In normalized binary, the leading digit of the significand is always 1.

### Floating-Point Representation
* MIPS uses the IEEE 754 floating-point standard format.
* It uses 1 bit to represent the sign, followed by 8 bits to represent the exponent, and 23 bits to represent the significand.
* Exponent is stored in "biased" notation: most negative exponent is all 0s, most positive is all 1s.
* "Biased notation stores a number N as an unsigned value N+B, where B is the bias. B is typically half the unsigned range, but doesn't have to be."
