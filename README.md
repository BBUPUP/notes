# Notes
### by [Elvin Yung](https://github.com/elvinyung)

This repo has all of my university notes, and some tooling for managing them.

## Table of Contents
* [Winter 2015](1151)
* [Spring 2016](1165)
* [Winter 2017](1171)

## Why?
I originally kept my university notes as separate repos for each term, but found that to be too annoying.

For legacy reasons, I'm keeping the old `1151notes` and `1165notes` repos, but adding them here as a subtree.
