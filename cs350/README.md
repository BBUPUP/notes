# The Hitchhiker's Guide to CS350

CS 350 - Operating Systems
Spring 2016
Elvin Yung

CS350 is an awesome course, but it's a lot of material. It can be overwhelming, especially if you're cramming 2 days before the final.

Thankfully, the course is split up into (roughly) 5 sections, which are mostly (but not completely) independent of each other:

* [Synchronization](synch.md)
  * threads
  * synchronization primitives: locks, semaphores, CVs
* [Kernel](kernel.md)
  * processes
  * system calls
  * context switches
* [Virtual Memory](vm.md)
  * address spaces
  * TLBs
* [Scheduling](scheduling.md)
  * first in first out (FIFO)
  * shortest job first (SJF)
  * shortest time-to-completion first (STCF)
  * round robin (RR)
  * multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ)
* [I/O](io.md) and [Filesystems](fs.md)
  * I/O devices
  * polling, vectored interrupts, DMA
  * device drivers
  * hard disks
  * I/O performance
  * filesystems
  * journaling
