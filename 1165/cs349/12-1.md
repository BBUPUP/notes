* We want to talk about physical limitations of your body, particularly in your visual acuity, etc.
* We care about this the most because most UIs are visual.

## Psychophysics
* Psychophysics is the idea that you are separate from the world.
* Seems philosophical, but the essentially it means that your perception of the physical world isn't perfect.
* Because your visual/audial perception isn't precise enough, we can do things like lossy compression, which lets us throw away data without noticing it.

## Temporal Resolution
* aka how you perceive the flickering of light
* At about 45 Hz, an *intermittent* flickering light starts to seem continuous. This is called the **critical flicker frequency** (CFF).
* This lets us do animation. Film is 24 fps, NTSC video is 60 fps, etc.
* The Hobbit films were the first to be shot at 48 fps. Some people complained that it made the special effects look more fake.

## The Human Eye
* At the edges of the retina, you don't actually have very good resolution.
* At the *macula* you have the best color depth, etc.

## Spatial Resolution
### Measuring Acuity
* 20/20 vision: You can perceive lines at 1 arc minute distance
* Implication: A dot pitch (i.e. pixel size) of 0.23 mm is sufficient for most people.

## Color
* Objective color: the actual math
* Subjective color: what color we think something is
* We agree on *most* subjective colors, but not all.
  * Remember the dress meme?

### the Visible Spectrum

### Additive Color Model
* We mostly use this
* Start with "nothing" (i.e. black), combine colored lights to combine white
* Works particularly well for monitors
* Variants: we use RGB for displays, HSV/HSB for color, YUV for human perception
  * YUV is biased towards things that the human eye can perceive well

### Subtractive Color Model
* Colored light is absorbed to create black.
* Works well with printed pages
* CMY/CMYK - common in printing

### HSV/HSB
* HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value/brightness.
* It is the most common model that we use for colors.
* Maps to visible spectrum.
* **Hue** is the actual color.
* **Saturation** is the richness of the color, i.e. from less hue to more hue.
* **Value** or **brightness** is a fixed-saturation representation for
* The model is represented spatially with hue going around, saturation extending out from the center, and brightness extending up.

* You've probably seen HSV represented in a color picker, where you pick the hue in a separate widget, and then get a 2D grid of the saturation and brightness.

### Perceiving Color
* Two different light sensors in the eye:
  * 6-7 million **cones** that perceive color
  * 120 million **rods** that distinguish light from dark
* Cones and rods are unevenly distributed.
* Rods are mostly in the periphery of vision, cones are mostly in the middle (a lot are packed together in the **fovea**).
* There's a tiny little blind spot in our vision, where our brains fill in the information.

* Humans are trichromatic. There are three main types of cones:
  * Blue cones aren't good at picking up color.
  * Green cones are great, which means that humans can generally perceive a wide spectrum of green colors.
  * Interestingly, our red cones are better at picking out yellow colors.
* Rods aren't great at picking out color, but they're better than nothing.
* Remember though that it's not just one cone that's responsible for receiving colors, but rather a combination of lots of cones.

* Color presentation matters.
* It's hard to distinguish two colors under these conditions:
  * **paleness**: the colors are pale.
  * **size**: the object is small or thin
  * **separation**: the color patches are far apart.

#### Color-blindness
* Precisely, color-blindness means that you're missing particular types of cones.
* **Monochromacy** is when you're missing 2 or 3 types of cone. This is super rare!
* **Dichromacy**:
  * Protanopia: missing red cones (~1% of males)
  * Deuteranopia: missing green cones (also ~1% of males)
  * Tritanopia: missing blue cones and blue sensitive rods. (super super rare)

#### Peripheral Vision
* We are essentially blind in the periphery, but it's still good for:
  * Guiding the fovea, which helps with eye movement
  * Detecting motion
  * Helping us see light in the dark, because rods are more light sensitive.

### Color and UI
To make messages visible:
  * Put messages where users are already looking.
  * Put the error message near what it refers to. (If this is in dispute with the above point, bias towards the above)
  * Use red for errors (but consider color-blindness)
  * Heavy artillery: pop-up alerts, sound, blink, motion, etc.

### Displays
* A pixel on a display is really made up of red, blue, and green components, which we call **sub-pixels**.
* This is why we use RGB for colors: we want to dictate how the pixel is exactly displayed.
* **Bit-depth** or **color-depth** in a display is the number of bits allocated to each pixel to specify the color.
  * e.g. 24 bits = 8 bits for each color, 16 bits = 5 red bits, 5 blue bits, 6 green bits (use 1 more bit for green because humans see green better)
  * 24 bits is about 16.7 million colors, which is generally enough.
  * We mostly do 32 bit displays, which lets us add an 8-bit alpha channel.

#### CRT
* Phosphor coating on screen
* Shoot at phosphor with an electron gun to make it emit light in different colors
* Since the light is very temporary, we need to shoot at it very frequently.
* Very bulky.

#### LCD

* We gradually shifted from CRT to LCD, because it's more portable.
* Use a layer of liquid crystal
* Rigid crystal membrane in the middle

##### "LED"
* Basically the same as an LCD display, except with an LED backlight.

#### OLED
* Like LCD, but throw away the crystal membrane in the middle
* We can build more flexible things with this display.
* Currently super expensive, but getting cheaper!

## tl;dr
* The physical world is different from our visual perception of it.
* When designing a UI, it's important to consider that difference.
