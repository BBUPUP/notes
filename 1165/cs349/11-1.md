## Models
* It's hard to look at a UI and determine how fast it can be used.
* The obvious solution: built all the possible solutions, and try all of them!
* Wait, don't do that. Building a high-fidelity demo from the ground up is costly in terms of time and money.
* What you want to do is come up with a model that lets you estimate how productive users can be with the interface.
* It's important to have an intuitive grasp of how long it takes to do something.

* We're going to focus on two things:
  * Time - how long it takes you to do something with the UI
  * Error rates - how often you make mistakes using the UI

### Keystroke Level Model (KLM)
* KLM is a simple model to estimate how long some task on a user interface takes.
* Break down the task into tiny little steps that are measurable in some atomic unit of cost, so that you get to measure
* Actions like keystroke, pointing, and mouse button presses are pretty well-defined in terms of the time it takes the average person to do it.
* KLM makes the assumption that there is no delay from the UI, which is one of the problems with it.
* KLM also assumes that the user doesn't make an error.

#### Operators

* As you might expect, a key press has a wide range of cost.
  * The best typists type at 0.08 seconds per character, and the worst typists type at 1.2 seconds per character.
  * So you need to figure out *who* you're modeling to be accurate.
* The assumptions are really important - if the user starts with their hand on the mouse or off the mouse
* Expect to see KLM estimation problems in the final.

#### Example
* Let's say we have three different widgets to enter a date.

* The first widget is just a simple text field where you enter a date in the format of `MM/DD/YYYY`.
* To enter a date in this text field, the average user would do something like this:
  1. Move the mouse cursor to the text field (1.1s)
  2. Click the mouse at the text field (0.1s)
  3. Move your hand from the mouse to the keyboard (0.4s)
  4. Type in 10 characters (10 * 0.3s = 3.0s)
* So in total time that this would take is about 4.6 seconds.

* The second widget are three dropdown menus, respectively for month, day, and year.
* The naive way to interact with this widget would be to individually select the items in each dropdown menu with your mouse - that takes 7.2 seconds in total.
* But a lot of users also focus on each dropdown, type in the keys for the item, and tab to the next widget. That takes significantly less time - about 3.3 seconds.

#### Mental Operations
* The examples we've so far don't consider the cost of a **mental operation**, which is basically any time the user has to stop and think.
* On average, when a user needs to think about what they want to do, it takes about 1.2 seconds according to the KLM model.
* As they're performing the task, they might need to think about things more.
* Basically, add an `M` operation whenever the user needs to think.
* It gets tricky to figure out when the average user would be thinking.
* In general, there's usually an initial phase before doing anything that the user thinks about the entire operation.

* KLM is simple to model, but it doesn't model pointing very well.
* It uses a constant 1.1s to estimate pointing, but it doesn't account for what device the user is using.
* More importantly, not every pointing action is the same! Obviously moving a longer distance takes more time.

### Fitts' Law
* A predictive model for 2D pointing
* Basically, it wants to answer this question: how long would it take an average user to go from point A to point B?
* Take any kind of pointing task in 2D space with any kind of pointing device
* Originally published in 1954, for modeling physical movement
* It's now the general go-to for estimating pointing

* Fitts' Law models the performance of some positional input device,
* Essentially, the time it takes to do move the pointer grows with the distance, and shrinks with the size of the target.
* So the relationship is modeled as this: `MT Î± D / S `

* More precisely, the formula is this: `MT = a + b log_2(D/W + 1)`
* We break the formula into two parts:
  * The **index of performance** `b`
  * The **index of difficulty** `log_2(D/W + 1)`

* Observation: If you have a button or widget, people generally target the center of the widget.

* Observation: something on the edge of viewport is considered as having infinite height/width (depending on the axis), because you essentially don't have to aim for the widget vertically/horizontally (also depending on the axis).

### Menus
#### Context Menus

* In terms of a Fitts' Law task, selecting an item on a dropdown context menu isn't great.
* The user has to think about where they want to go (i.e. an O(n) search).
* When there are a lot of items, the distance becomes unwieldy.

#### Pie Menus

* Another idea: arrange the menu in a "pie" centered around the pointer, where each item is a slice of the pie.
* Nicely solves the distance problem - every item is the exact same distance from the pointer
* Problem: if you have lots of items, the slices get really small.
* At about 11 items, a pie menu becomes worse than context menus in terms of performance.

### Visual vs. Motor Space
* OSX has a feature where dock items magnify when you hover near them. (Side anecdote about how [Bas Ording] got hired by Steve Jobs just by showing him this)
* It expands the object in *visual* or *screen* space, but not in *motor* space.
* According to Fitts' Law, expanding the size of the object dynamically doesn't change how easy it is to select the item.

* To make the UI "sticky" in the motor space but not the visual space, you could make the cursor move slower over the widget.
* You don't see this often, because it's actually pretty annoying.

### Steering Law
* Fitts' Law is great, but assumes that you always take the straight path from point A to point B.
* How we we account for a meandering/constrained path?
* For example, select something on an inner context menu.

* We model the path as a series of "goals.
* The total cost is then the sum of moving from every `i`th goal to the `i+1`th goal.

### tl;dr
* Make things bigger and closer to make it easier for people to get to.
