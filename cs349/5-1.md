## Usefulness vs. Usability
* **Usefulness** is the ability of an interface to support different tasks and practical use cases.
* **Usability** is how effectively and efficiently users can achieve tasks with it.
* The goal is to make interfaces both useful and usable.

* Over time, devices have become more and more capable, but humans have stayed at roughly the same level of capability

## The Design of Everyday Things
A few takeaways from *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman (cofounder of the Nielsen Norman group, previously VP at Apple ATC):
* Form the correct mental models.
* Frequently-used functionalities should have explicit controls.
* Appearance should reflect/suggest use
* Rarely-used functions shouldn't have the same level of support/emphasis as more frequently-used ones.
* Give feedback of operations in progress (i.e. it should be easy to figure out what it's doing)
