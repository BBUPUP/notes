## Smartwatches
![](https://xkcd.com/1420/)

* We're deliberately not going to talk about things like Fitbits and Pebbles, because they're more specialized.
* We'll focus on the Apple Watch and Android Wear, which are generalized.

### Design Challenges
* The first issue is that these things are tiny! You're constrained by the user's hand.
  * Things like the fat finger problem are much worse.
  * Physical buttons are important - you need buttons because there's no practical way a touchscreen works.
* Limited attention
  * A smartwatch is not intended to be the device of choice for complicated use cases - you're not going to be manipulating spreadsheets
  * Instead, smartwatches are for quick tasks on the go - things you want to
  be able to do without having to pull out their phone.

#### Guidelines from Google
* The watch is mostly an output device, not an input device.
* Google suggests all computation to be done on the phone, and be sent to the watch - in other words, the watch should just be a dumb terminal.
* The entire task on the watch should take <5 seconds - if it takes more, a watch is not the right device.
* The watch is *secondary* - it's only auxiliary to the phone, designed for quick interactions.

#### Guidelines from Apple
* Apple emphasizes personal communication on the Apple Watch. They emphasize initiating communicating, but it's not a very compelling use case.
* There are dedicated apps (but no one uses them).
* Interaction mostly via gestures, but there's also force touch, the "crown" dial, and the side buttons.
* Emphasize coordination with smartphone - should be able to tap to answer a call from the watch, and then the control is transferred to the phone.

### The Big Question
*Why doesn't everyone have a smartwatch?*

* No "killer app" or other compelling use cases
  * Probably not good enough as a proxy for phone
  * Fitness tracking isn't sufficient for most people
  * Healthcare, monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, etc. - maybe?
  * Identification - Apple Pay, Android Pay, computer authentication etc. - maybe eventually replace passwords
* Price
* Battery sucks
* etc.

### Utilitarian vs. Fashionable Devices
* Is a smartwatch a piece of jewelry or a utility device?

## Ubiquitous Computing
* Introduced by Mark Weiser, 1996
* Basically a very old term for Internet of Things
* Instead of having discrete devices that you carry, instrument the world around you to do things for you.
* For Ubicomp to really work, you need:
  * Computation embedded into the environment
  * Something that ties the person to the environment - a device that helps identify the person. Can a smartwatch fill this role? Maybe.

## Augmented Reality
* Examples: Google Glass, Hololens

### Design Principles
* Don't get in the way of what the user is doing
* Only give information that's relevant to what the user is currently doing. Don't always put the temperature in the corner!
* Avoid showing things

### Results
Google Glass didn't get wide adoption. What happened?

* Technology was not super feasible - 2 hour battery life?
* Principles of Ubicomp
* Google Glass was considered rude or awkward - [Glassholes](https://nypost.com/2014/07/14/is-google-glass-cool-or-just-plain-creepy/)
  * There were cameras mounted on them, and when someone is walking around with Google Glass on, there's no indication that they're not recording you
  * Is Glass a fashion device? Google tried to make it like that, but

AR definitely still has potential, though!

## More Generally for Wearables
And also other new technology.

* Why do you need a wearable?

* A better mousetrap is not good enough -  it needs to be solving a problem - 10x not 10%.
* New technology takes time to mature! Remember old tablets and PDAs?
