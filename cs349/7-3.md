## A Brief History of Interaction

* Recall the [first lecture](1-1.md) of the course.
* Early "computers" were literally a bunch of people calculating things like
* There were some early mechanical calculators, like the [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).
* A company called [International Business Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) made the ASCC, which weighted about 11 tons - and were controlled with hundreds of dials.

### Batch Interfaces
*  - mid 1960s ish
* Feed instructions to computers using *punch cards*.
* No real interaction - the machine provides feedback in a matter of hours or days.
* The cost of getting something wrong was huge - it takes a very long time to iterate.

### Conversational Interfaces
* 1965 - ~1985
* User types a command in a prompt, the system evaluates the command, and then provides feedback.
* You basically still had to be an expert to use them.
* e.g. Zork, Bash

![Zork](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55182b4ee4b0c6d76a9c1eb3/t/552f3011e4b07f0b392386cf/1429155859834/)

* Highly flexible
* The interaction is usually well-suited to the machine, but not to the task.
* You had to learn a lot of technical concepts before understanding how to use the system.
* Requires *recall* rather than *recognition* - i.e. the interface isn't intuitive enough for a beginner to be able to figure it out. You literally had to know the command syntax to use it.

### Visionaries
#### Vannevar Bush
* In 1945, Vannevar Bush authored [As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/).
* In it, he suggested the idea of a device called a [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) - a tool to organize information with *links* between annotated pieces of content.
* [Sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)
* It was a futuristic vision - the technology was definitely nowhere near.

> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.

#### Ivan Sutherland
* Ivan Sutherland came up with Sketchpad, a device controlled with a light pen that let users directly manipulate shapes with a proto-graphical user interface.
* Under the hood, the graphics were manipulated similarly to a constraint solver.
* He was interested in building tools not for experts, but for people like artists and draftsmen. (i.e. task-driven)
* Sketchpad's software was the first to use the concept of a *window*.

> A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland.

#### Douglas Engelbart
* Career spanned 50s - 90s ish
* Led a team of researchers at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
* His researchers developed the beginnings of some extremely advanced technologies: mouse, hypertext, collaborative software, etc.
* [Mother of All Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) - hour and a half long demo in 1968 demonstrating those technologies.

> An advantage of being online is that it keeps track of who you are and what youâ€™re doing all the time.

#### Alan Kay
* Xerox PARC - worked on the Xerox Star and the Xerox Alto, the earliest personal computers with a GUI and Ethernet
* Dynabook - conceptual prototype for laptops/tablets
* Helped develop object-oriented programming (Smalltalk), Ethernet, the graphical user interfaces ...

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

* The Star cost $75k for a basic system, $16k for each additional workstation
* This is why you haven't heard of it.

(Offhand mention that Alan Kay did an [AMA on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11939851) very recently.)

#### Apple
* Steve Jobs "[steals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1rXqD6M614)" Xerox PARC research
* GUI technology gets used in the Macintosh and the Lisa
* And the rest is history!

* Better feedback
* Metaphors

### The future?
* Touchscreen/[pens](https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/jobs-if-you-see-a-stylus-or-a-task-manager-they-blew-it/)
* Natural language processing
* Virtual/augmented reality
* Brain (machine|computer) interface
