## User Centered Design

How do you build software for people who aren't you?

You have to talk to the customer, figure out:
* what they need
* what problems they have with current solutions

You need to think about the people who use your software, and to test your ideas with them.

*Developers are not people.* You are not the user - you can't just build it to your specifications.

### History

Started with the original Macintosh team at Apple.

The original process: bring in users, show them stuff, and iterate.

(citation needed. I can't seem to find any source that actually supports this claim; the closest I could get to was [Andy Hertzfeld's story](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Shut_Up.txt) about demoing a Mac prototype to Microsoft.)

### Principles
* Understanding users' needs
* Design the UI first - not the architecture. Choose the technology to fit the needs, not [the other way around](http://www.mongodb-is-web-scale.com/). (This isn't exactly a hard and fast rule - sometimes you need to figure out if something is technically feasible)
* Iterate!
* Use your own software - "Eat your own dogfood."
* Look at other people using it - and in real life, not some sort of lab.

### Iteration Cycle

TODO: add flowchart here

(Caveat: this diagram assumes you won't change the architecture, which isn't always true in real life.)

### Understanding the User
* *Observe existing solutions.* [It's important to see how the user uses the software.](http://javlaskitsystem.se/2012/02/whats-the-waiter-doing-with-the-computer-screen/) You need to design the scenario that you're working with, and meeting the requirements that they want.
* *List scenarios.* e.g. for an email client, figure out what the flow for sending an email should be like, replying to an email, forwarding an email, creating a mailbox, etc. Scenarios are great because they're a natural place to talk about what the user is doing, in the context that they're doing it. Collect data from a bunch of users - catch a wide range of use cases.
* *List and prioritize functions.* Figure out what scenarios need what, and prioritize.
* *List functions by frequency and commonality.* Common functionalities should be accessible with few clicks, more obscure use cases hidden in menus.

### Designing the UI
* *Temporal distribution*: steps in the flow
* *Spatial distribution*: where components appear on a section

* Use **storyboards** to mock up the basic flow for (typically) scenarios.
* Describe interaction sequences: plan interaction paths like a flowchart
* Testing the design: quickly prototype, test with users, and iterate.
