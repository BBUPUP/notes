## What is a User Interface?
Some definitions that might work:
* how humans see the computer
* where humans and computers meet

A real definition:
* A *user interface* is where a a person can express *intention* to the device, and the device can present *feedback*.

UIs don't just refer to how you interact with computers: Microwaves, refrigerators, door bells, hammers, jets...

## A Brief History of Computer UIs
### Pre 1970s
* Computers had *batch* interfaces.
* They were rudimentary and mostly non-interactive.
* The hot new computers of the day: ENIAC,
* Giving a computer instructions involved [punching holes in cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card)...

### 1970s - early 1980s
* We got *conversational* interfaces, i.e. command lines.
* We mainly saw them in two different places: *microcomputers* (the first personal computers), and *terminals* ("dumb" video display clients connected to mainframes).

* Some kid named Bill Gates bought a [Quick and Dirty Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) to use in IBM PCs (and IBM clones), for just $50,000...

### late 1980s - now?
* Xerox's Palo Alto Research Park (PARC) developed amazing technologies around this time, things like Ethernet networking and object-oriented programming.
* The one that got the most attention was the bitmapped display. It let you show completely *graphical* user interfaces in your software, controlled with a device called a *mouse*.
* Xerox was too focused on their photocopier products, and never really capitalized on their innovations. They made some very expensive workstations based on the GUI and Ethernet, the Alto (1973) and the Star (1981), which never really sold well.
* In exchange for a small stake in Apple, Xerox let Steve Jobs [visit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u70CgBr-OI) PARC. ["Xerox grabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1rXqD6M614)
* Apple ended up using the technology in the Lisa (which was a huge failure), and then the [Macintosh](http://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh) (which started off a hit, but ended up also a huge failure).

* Some [other company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sforhbLiwLA) that [has no taste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJWWtV1w5fw) took the ideas for the GUI and [ran with it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0). And [bad things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.) happened.

![They just have no taste.](http://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/23/db9b07b8-1bd3-4451-9365-7bd336f4d7dd/resize/1170x878/6a5511eafc6e9a454add33945466f8ed/cmwindows1-0jul15a.jpg)

### 1990s -
* 1989: Tim Berners-Lee came up with a hypertext format to be sent over network connection. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Tim decided to call his neat invention the WorldWideWeb.
* 1993: Marc Andreesen makes a web browser called Mosaic. It add graphics to web pages. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Mosaic eventually became Netscape.
* People started putting `.com` at the end of their company name. It was a weird time.

### now? - future?
* Touchscreens

* Voice

### How Has Computing Changed?
* The introduction of the GUI *fundamentally* changed how we use technology.
* Computers went from being a specialist tool to being used by everyone, without having to be an expert or build their own software.

## Interactive System Architecture
* The user has a *mental model* - how it thinks the device works.
* The device has a *system model* - how it actually works.
* Interaction: the user expresses an intention to the device, and the device presents feedback about that intention.
* An *event*, to the user, is an observable occurrence or phenomenon. To the system, it's a message saying that something happened.

## Interface vs. interaction
* *Interface* is how the device presents itself to the user. These include controls, and visual, physical, and auditory cues.
* *Interaction* is the user's actions to perform a task, and how the device responds.

## Designing Interactions
* Designing good interaction is hard because users, and the things they want to do, are all different.
* Can you anticipate all scenarios?
* There's no single right way to build an interface - it can always be improved.

## Why Study Interaction?
* The right computer is a [bicycle for the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c&t=25s).
* A well designed tool with a good interface can radically improve our productivity and let us do things that we couldn't dream of before.
* New technology becomes widespread not when it becomes more powerful, but when it becomes easy to use.
