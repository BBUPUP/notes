### Checkpointing
* Conceptually, undo is similar to something called **checkpointing**.
* Checkpointing is a way of manually undoing something - like saving and and reloading in a video game.
* Undo/redo is basically an automated way of checkpointing.
* Version control systems like Git are a way of checkpointing.

### Benefits
* There's quite a bit of research done in this area, about how people use GUIs.
* People rely on undo-redo not just to revert mistakes, but also to experiment with the UI, *without fear of commitment*.
* Fast undo-redo lets you compare two different states very easily.
* This is actually one of the features that you basically have to include, for a usable GUI.

### Design Decisions
* You have to make a bunch of design decision

* *What's undoable?* Not everything should be. For example, if I resize a window, it isn't normally undoable. Usually it's data changes that are undoable.
* *Destructive* operations are difficult to undo, e.g. quitting an application with unsaved data, emptying the trash.
  * When users initiate a destructive action, the UI usually does something to make sure the user is suer they want to do it, like showing a "are you sure?" dialog box.
* Some things can't be undone. e.g. printing.

#### Suggestions
* Every change to the model should be undoable.
*
* Ask for confirmation.

### Representing an Undo
* How does the UI reflect the undo/redo?
* e.g. should you highlight the thing that the undo restored?

#### Suggestions
* The restored item should be highlighted, since before the delete, it was selected.
* It's probably meaningful for the scroll to move to the restored text. e.g. Sublime Text does this.

### Granularity
* What should be considered as an undoable step?
* It's pretty obvious in most cases, but there are some ambiguities.
* For example, should typing a character be considered a discrete action, or should the smallest unit be an entire word?
* Different text editing software handle this differently.
* Another example: A paint-like app, where you use the mouse to draw strokes.
* In this case, a mousedown-mousedrag-mouseup sequence (i.e. drawing an entire line segment) should be an entire action, instead of each mouse drag.

#### Suggestions
* Ignore
* An interface event should be one step - e.g. find and replace all. In other words, if it takes one click to make that change, it should be considered a single change.
* Delimit on user input breaks - like spaces

### Scope
* At what level does undo operate - at system, application, document, or widget level?
* Obviously, when you do something in Photoshop, and then do something in Word, when you go back to Photoshop and undo something, it shouldn't affect Word.
* It gets tricker when you involve a software that can have multiple documents at the same time.
* Usually in this case, you maintain a separate undo
* In general: It should be at the application level, unless you can open more than one document in the app. Then it should be document level.

## Implementation
### sdfsdf
#### Option 1: Forward Undo
* Save the state periodically, and log all the changes (or *diffs*) to the current state since that change.
* To undo, get the new state by replaying the last n-1 change records from the last saved state.

#### Option 2: Reverse Undo
*

### Change Record Implementation
#### Option 1: Memento Pattern
* Save *every* different state in the history.
* When you undo, you can just go back to the last state.
* Clearly, this is pretty inefficienct in terms of state use.

#### Option 2: Command Pattern
* Every time you make a change, add a
* Generally, this is partially implemented with checkpointing,
* [Square root decomposition](http://www.infoarena.ro/blog/square-root-trick)

##### Two Stacks
* Keep track of two stacks: an *undo stack* and a *redo stack*.
* Every time you do something, you put it on the undo stack.
* Every time you undo something, you pop from the undo stack, and push it to the redo stack.
* If undo something and then do something else, clear the redo stack.
* Some software might do some more complicated stuff like keeping a tree, but this is how it's basically implemented.

### Undo in Swing
* Swing has an undo manager, provided in `javax.swing.undo.*`.
* It exposes an `UndoManager` class, which you usually put in your model.
* When you implement the method that performs some change, you add an `AbstractUndoableEdit` object to the `UndoManager`.
* The `UndoManager` has `undo` and `redo` methods to do the actual operations, which you typically bind to your accelerator keys.

### "Destructive" commands
Consider a situation like this:

You have a few options of resolving this:
* Use forward command undo.
* Use Memento. When it's difficult to reconstruct the state from scratch, you're better off taking a snapshot.

## Transferring Data
* We consider drag-and-drop as the same thing as cut-paste, since they're both basically removing data from somewhere, and putting it somewhere.
* Why do we care about this?
* It's the primary mechanism to transfer information.

* A clipboard where any application can access is a huge security risk. People copy some pretty sensitive things.
* We don't address this in this course, but it's something to consider.

* Copy-and-paste is essentially IPC - you need a common format for it to work between different programs.
* It's straightforward for text, but how do you do it for things like graphics, where some formats might be proprietary, or not universally supported?

### Implementation
* In OSX, The application indicates what formats it supports.
* When you copy something, the data is usually copied *lazily*, i.e. isn't copied onto the clipboard. Usually it only adds a placeholder or a reference.
* This is better because sometimes copied data might never be pasted.

* Every OS/windowing system/toolkit does it differently.
* In Java, look at `java.awt.datatransfer`.
* Java has two kinds of clipboard: a system clipboard, and also a local clipboard, which is a clipboard that only your application can access.
* Don't use the local clipboard - the main point of copy-and-paste is to be able to transfer data between different programs.

### Drag-and-Drop
* As we said, drag-and-drop is identical to copy-and-paste.
* The only difference is that you need listeners on the source and destination widgets to move the data.
