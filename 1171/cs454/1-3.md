## The Fallacies of Distributed Computing
While at Sun Microsystems, [Peter Deutsch](https://books.google.ca/books?id=mShXzzKtpmEC&pg=PA14) came up with the [Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing](https://blogs.oracle.com/jag/resource/Fallacies.html):

> 1.	The network is reliable
> 2.	Latency is zero
> 3.	Bandwidth is infinite
> 4.	The network is secure
> 5.	Topology doesn't change
> 6.	There is one administrator
> 7.	Transport cost is zero
> 8.	The network is homogeneous

[This article](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/fallacies.pdf) explains them.
