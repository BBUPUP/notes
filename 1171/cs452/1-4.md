*Note:* I think the notes are pretty good, so this mostly consists of interesting things he says.

* A **shift register** is a register that allows for efficient bitwise operations. It basically uses a [barrel shifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_shifter), which lets you shift without using up a full cycle.
* Efficiently exploiting shift registers improves *code density*, which ultimately means that the executable takes up less memory.
* The ARM architecture makes heavy use of it.
